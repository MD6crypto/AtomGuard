AtomGuard: Blockchain Agnostic Security Toolkit

To be honest any individual of any ethnicity will be able to benefit from this project, it is an Interoperable security solution to accommodate Security Professionals, Journalists, Privacy Advocates, Businesses, Schools, Blockchains, Node validators, and Individuals with learning disabilities. Anyone trying to use the internet privately will benefit from this project because a VPN can hide your IP address and encrypt your data traffic. This makes doing important tasks that require sensitive data or communication safe from malicious actors. 

With the rise of Data Breaches, Identity Theft, and Cyber warfare there is not enough being done to protect peoples sensitive data and people will need what were making because we aim to hash the network traffic at the DNS level. Additional ecosystems will benefit because Interoperability is needed for crypto and blockchain to thrive and making the environment safer for the users and participants will help facilitate the integration into web3.

We plan to integrate on the XRPL by providing a VPN and security tools so XRPL toolkit user's and Validators can be kept safe while interacting with the XRPL as they normally would but through a secure tunnels. We will also provide educational resources, guides, demos to implement better security practices for home labs and businesses to start integrating into WIFI 6 and WPA3. 

We plan to execute our Milestones by creating a secure environment using hardware and software such as pfsense and Juniper Labs along with various cloud in environments and VPS's then penetration testing the product and cleaning up an bugs so its ready for launch

Our demo is currently functioning
